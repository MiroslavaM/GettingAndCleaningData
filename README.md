#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

##Course Project Description
 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Repository Content
This repository contains 3 files
1. README.md - information about steps followed for solving the course project
2. Codebook.md - codebook of a dataset variables along with information about data cleaning performed. 
3. run_analysis.R - R code that executes steps 1 to 5 with some short descriptions

##Steps followed for solving the course project

<b>Preliminary work</b>- Downloading and uzipping the data file from the url using R. Getting familiar with the datasets, looking through each file, getting information about the data it contains using str() and summary().
